there's a took named mknfonts.tool which reads .ttf fonts (among others) and

      ## Make the fonts and leave them in the Fonts directory
      cd /usr/share/GNUstep/Fonts
      mknfonts /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/*

      ## Set the defaults for NSFont to something other than Helvetica
      defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSFont <font name>

      defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSFont FreeSans
